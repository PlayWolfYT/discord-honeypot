# Discord-Honeypot
This is a simple honey-pot which automizes user-accounts and sends DMs and Friend-Requests to a webhook and or report-channel.

# ATTENTION!
Automating Discord User Accounts is **AGAINST DISCORD TERMS OF SERVICE** ([See Here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-User-Accounts-Self-Bots)). 

The accounts for the honeypots may be at risk of getting banned, therefore do not use any important accounts. *Usually* it should be fine, as long as discords API doesnt get spammed, though there is absolutely **no guarantee**!

Use at your own risk.
